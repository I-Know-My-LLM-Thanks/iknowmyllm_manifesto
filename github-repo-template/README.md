> **We are uncovering better ways to evaluate AI platforms by doing it and helping others do it.**

## 🎯 The Manifesto

Through our work and collective experience, we have come to value:

| We Value More | Over |
|--------------|------|
| **Evidence** | Promises |
| **Transparency** | Hype |
| **Accountability** | Obscurity |
| **Due Diligence** | Blind Trust |
| **Human Oversight** | AI Worship |
| **Community Wisdom** | Isolated Judgment |

While we acknowledge that items on the right have value, we have come to value the items on the left more.

## 📋 The 8 Principles

We follow these actionable principles to protect ourselves and others from AI fraud:

1. **Verify Credentials Thoroughly** — Dig into roles, histories, and team depth—beyond profiles, seek independent confirmation.

2. **Demand Concrete Proof** — Require working demos, named references, and verifiable case studies before sharing data.

3. **Spot Hype and Jargon** — Identify invented terms, generic AI copy, and unsubstantiated claims as red flags.

4. **Audit Security Independently** — Check certifications, data practices, and access controls—don't trust words alone.

5. **Research Regulatory Standing** — Review FINRA, SEC, FCA filings, and physical/financial legitimacy for stability.

6. **Question Urgency and Terms** — Challenge artificial scarcity, NDAs, and exit options—ensure fair, transparent deals.

7. **Document Everything** — Record claims, communications, and interactions for accountability.

8. **Leverage Instincts and Community** — Trust your gut; consult shared wisdom and collective experiences when in doubt.

## 🎪 Hall of Amusing Red Flags

Real patterns we've encountered (anonymized but unembellished). You couldn't make this stuff up.

- **The "Combined Experience" Math**: "100+ years combined AI experience" — LinkedIn reveals 35 years total, 4 in AI specifically.
- **The "Senior Bank Executive"**: No FINRA registration. Actually a project manager who worked on CRM upgrades.
- **The Revolutionary Terminology**: "Cognitive Knowledge Orchestration™" — Zero Google Scholar results.
- **The Confidential Case Study**: "A leading consortium reduced timelines by 73%" — Cannot be named, contacted, or verified.

# Contributing to I Know My LLM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the I Know My Own LLM manifesto. This document provides guidelines for participation.

## Our Philosophy

This manifesto is community-driven and open for refinement. We believe collective wisdom is stronger than individual judgment.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Signing the Manifesto

Two quick options to sign:

**Option A: Google Form (Easiest)**

[✨ Sign via Google Form](https://forms.gle/3xKuRVxmhV6pUiL76)

**Option B: GitHub Issue**

[🐙 Sign via GitHub Issue](https://github.com/I-Know-My-Own-LLM/iknowmyownllm_manifesto/issues/new?template=signature-and-redflag-request.md)

**Important notes:**
- Emails in the CSV are publicly displayed! Only the google form requires the actual emails, and will not publish it if you chose so.
- Anonymous signatures are respected and verified through the PR process.

### 2. Suggesting Principle Changes

**Before proposing changes:**
- Read the current [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md)
- Check existing Issues and Discussions for similar suggestions
- Consider how your suggestion aligns with the manifesto principles

**To propose a change:**
1. Open an Issue using the "Principle Suggestion" [template](https://github.com/I-Know-My-Own-LLM/iknowmyownllm_manifesto/issues/new?template=principle-suggestion.md)
2. Explain the rationale for your change
3. Provide evidence or examples supporting the modification
4. Engage constructively with community feedback

#### Website Formatting Notes (Principles)

The homepage pulls the principles list directly from `PRINCIPLES.md`.

- Each principle must start with `## N. Title`
- The first bold line is used as the short summary
- An optional line starting with `Red flag example:` is used for the example snippet

### 3. Sharing Red Flag Patterns

We collect anonymized patterns in the "Hall of Amusing Red Flags". Use the **Signing the Manifesto** section, to include a redflag with your signature.

1. Open an Issue using the [Signature template](https://github.com/I-Know-My-Own-LLM/iknowmyownllm_manifesto/issues/new?template=signature-and-redflag-request.md)
2. Describe the pattern generically (no specific company names)
3. Explain why this pattern is concerning
4. Include any verification methods that helped identify it

#### Red Flags Data (CSV)

The homepage loads the Hall of Amusing Red Flags from `public/red_flag_stories.csv`.

- Columns: `icon,title,claim,reality,example`
- Wrap any field that contains commas in quotes
- Keep content anonymized and pattern-based

Example row:
```csv
"🎪","The Overpromised Demo","Sign the NDA first","Promises without proof are not proof","Ask for a sandbox before sharing data"
```

### 4. Participating in Discussions

Join our Discussions to:
- Debate principle refinements
- Share community stories and experiences
- Ask questions about applying the principles
- Connect with like-minded professionals

## Content Guidelines

### Do
- Focus on generic, educational patterns
- Provide constructive, evidence-based suggestions
- Respect diverse perspectives and experiences

- Cite sources when making factual claims

### Don't
- Name specific companies, individuals, or products
- Share potentially defamatory content

## Legal Safety

To maintain broad applicability and legal safety:

- All examples must be anonymized - no real company names
- Focus on patterns, not specifics - describe behaviors, not entities
- Avoid potentially defamatory language - stick to verifiable facts
- When in doubt, **generalize**!
